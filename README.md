# A production-grade complete MERN web app for Blogging.

## About the Project

<p>This is my first end to end web App project using MERN stack in JavaScript.</p>
<p>There's not that much to brag about, Blogstagram is just a simple TODO application. Yeah that is what is it is. The only variation is, here you can associate images, videos along with your TODOS. The other users can see your TODOS (in the sense blogs), they can like your posts, comment on the same. If wanted, users can follow each other. Other than this, you can explore more about the features (not too many) about the project [here](https://blogstagram-frontend.vercel.app/)</p>

## More about the Tech Stack

### Backend (Node JS)

<p>This was the part I enjoyed the most. I used NodeJS and ExpressJS as the backend. Wrote the APIs and controllers in a production grade setting. Wrote reusable middlewares and utilities. Got to know how backend is kept well organised.</p>

## Database

<p>Did basic CRUD operations with mongoose (MongoDB Atlas as the database on cloud)</p>

## Frontend

<p>Integrated the backend with a a functional react frontend. Using Tailwind CSS for the styling. There are still a lot of things to work on for the react part. Right now, the web App is minimally styled. Any suggestions are always welcome</p>

## Extra Technologies

<p>While building this project, the first major problem which i came across is uploading videos , images on the database. This made me go through a lot of docs, and eventually I used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for storing the images, videos associated with the posts.</p>

<footer>So, for now, that is the information I felt sharing regarding this project, I have still plenty of things to work on for this application. Any ideas from the community is always welcome.</footer>
